{"name":"Ng-route-ext","tagline":"Extended version of AngularJS ngRoute module that supports namings and different animations between views","body":"# AngularJS module for simple routing with animations support\r\n\r\n## The problem\r\n\r\nOne of the worst pains of the original ngRoute module is weak animations support. It only supports one type of animation for all views changes. The main idea of this module is to provide support for different animations for different views (e.g. next and previous pages animated with left and right transitions, or flip left/right between some kind of pages).\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nThe module provides small extention of Angular's DSL for describing routes. So that you can use different animations for different views.\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n\r\n    $routeProvider\r\n      .when('/',\r\n        templateUrl: 'index.html'\r\n        controller: 'IndexController'\r\n        name: 'index'\r\n        animations:\r\n          pictures: ['slide-to-top', 'slide-from-bottom']\r\n      )\r\n      .when('/pictures',\r\n        templateUrl: 'pictures.html'\r\n        controller: 'PicturesController'\r\n        name: 'pictures'\r\n        animations:\r\n          index: ['slide-from-bottom', 'slide-to-top']\r\n      )\r\n\r\n## How it reads\r\n\r\nFirst, notice two new fields: name and animations. `animations` is a hash which reads as follows:\r\n\r\n        name: 'pictures'\r\n        animations:\r\n          index: ['slide-from-bottom', 'slide-to-top']\r\n\r\n`when moving to \"pictures\" page from \"index\" page use \"slide-from-bottom\" animation for index and \"slide-to-top\" animation for pictures page`","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
